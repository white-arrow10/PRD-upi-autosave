# UPI AutoSave

A small case study where I explored a simple idea:

> What if saving money happened *automatically* every time you paid with UPI?

Instead of telling Gen-Z to “build discipline,”  
UPI AutoSave sneaks micro-savings into daily payments — round-ups, goal-based nudges, and tiny wins.

## ✦ What this project is

- I wrote a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**
- Built **Figma wireframes** for how AutoSave shows up in the UPI payment flow
- Designed a quick **GTM + A/B test plan** to validate whether people actually use the feature

All of this is based on:
- ~10 user interviews
- 100+ app reviews (GPay, PhonePe, Jar, Gullak, etc.)
- A simple insight:  
  *People want to save — the UI just doesn't make it effortless.*

## ✦ The core idea

1. You pay someone on UPI  
2. Success screen pops up  
3. AutoSave quietly asks: *“Want to save ₹3?”*  
4. You tap nothing, it saves anyway 🤫

You spend → you save.  
No extra apps. No thinking.

## ✦ Why I did this

I like solving problems where behavior > motivation.

Design shouldn't just look good.  
It should make the **right action the easiest one**.
